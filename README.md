- **Enterprise CA VM** - Windows Server with AD CS for certificate issuance
- **Client Test VM** - To generate and test HTTPS traffic
- **Azure Key Vault** - Secure storage for TLS certificates
- **Virtual Network** - Hub network with proper routing

## Lab Components

### Infrastructure (Bicep Templates)
- `main.bicep` - Main deployment template
- `modules/` - Modular Bicep templates for each component
- `parameters/` - Environment-specific parameter files

### Scripts
- `scripts/` - PowerShell and Azure CLI automation scripts
- `certificates/` - Certificate generation and management scripts

### Documentation
- `docs/` - Step-by-step deployment guides
- Lab validation and testing procedures

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with permissions to create resources
- Azure CLI installed and configured
- PowerShell 7+ for script execution
- Basic understanding of PKI and certificate management

## Getting Started

1. Review the architecture documentation
2. Deploy the infrastructure using Bicep templates
3. Configure the Enterprise CA
4. Generate and deploy certificates
5. Test TLS inspection functionality

## AI Integration

This lab showcases how AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude can assist with:

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **This is a lab environment** - Do not use in production without proper security review and hardening.

## Current Deployment Status

✅ **Azure MCP Server Connected**: Successfully authenticated to your Azure subscription
- **Subscription**: `ME-MngEnvMCAP392206-thordraper-1`
- **Subscription ID**: `e440a65b-7418-4865-9821-88e411ffdd5b`

✅ **Initial Infrastructure Deployed** (East US):
- Resource Group: `rg-azfw-tls-lab`
- Virtual Network: `azfw-tls-lab-vnet` (10.0.0.0/16)
- Azure Firewall Premium: `azfw-tls-lab-firewall`

- Public IP: `104.45.196.25`
- Key Vault: `azfw-tls-lab-kv-2025`

## 🌐 Multi-Region Strategy

Due to capacity constraints in East US for specific VM sizes, we're implementing a **strategic multi-region approach**:

### Primary Region (East US)
- ✅ **Azure Firewall Premium** - Core TLS inspection capability
- ✅ **Virtual Network** - Hub network infrastructure  
- ✅ **Key Vault** - Certificate storage and management
- ✅ **Firewall Policy** - TLS inspection rules and configuration

### Backup Region (West US 2)  
- 🔄 **Virtual Machines** - CA server and client VMs (deploying now)
- 🎯 **Strategic Benefits**:
  - **Immediate Solution**: Overcome East US capacity constraints
  - **Cross-Region Testing**: Test connectivity through Azure Firewall across regions
  - **Business Continuity**: Practice multi-region disaster recovery scenarios
  - **Performance Analysis**: Compare latency and throughput across regions
  - **Certificate Management**: Test distributed PKI infrastructure

### Testing Scenarios Enabled
1. **Standard TLS Inspection**: VMs → Firewall → Internet
2. **Cross-Region Connectivity**: West US VMs → East US Firewall → Internet
3. **Regional Failover**: Primary to backup region scenarios
4. **Certificate Distribution**: Multi-region CA certificate deployment

This setup provides both **immediate lab functionality** and **real-world enterprise architecture experience**.

## Quick Start Deployment

Since you're already authenticated with Azure MCP server, you can continue the deployment:

### Option 1: Use Azure MCP Server (Current Approach)
```bash
# Continue with VM deployment in West US 2
# The Azure MCP server commands are being used to deploy step-by-step
```

### Option 2: Use Local Bicep Templates
```bash
# Update parameters and deploy using Azure CLI
./scripts/deploy-lab.sh deploy
```

## What We've Demonstrated

This lab showcases **AI-assisted Azure deployment** in action:

1. **Natural Language to Azure Commands**: Used Azure MCP server to translate deployment intentions into Azure CLI commands
2. **Real-time Problem Solving**: When capacity issues arose, AI helped pivot to alternative regions
3. **Iterative Deployment**: Building infrastructure piece by piece with AI guidance
4. **Adaptive Planning**: Adjusting deployment strategy based on real Azure constraints

## Next Steps
